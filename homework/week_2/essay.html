<h1>How to Become a Tribal Leader </h1>
<h2>Excerpt from Tribal Leadership</h2>
<h3>By Dave Logan, John King & Halee Fischer-Wright </h3>
<hr>
<p>The people who use the stage-specific leverage points to upgrade the tribal culture emerge as Tribal leaders. Such individuals,<br>
     we’ve found in our research, do a lot of work on themselves as they make changes in the tribe. 
    This “Tribal Leader prep work” includes</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Learning the language and customs of all five cultural stages.<br> 
            Look at the next six chapters as a travel guide for all five lands.</li>
        <li>Listening for which tribal members speak which language- in essence, who is at what stage?</li>

        <li>Moving yourself forward, so that your own “center of gravity” is at least Stage Four. <br>
            You can do this only by talking a different language and shifting the structure of relationships around you. <br>
            Chapter 7 is the most important in the book -if you let it, it will nudge you into seeing the value of Stage Four and the hollowness of<br> 
            Stage Three. We suggest you spend some time thinking about the content of that chapter and discussing it with important people in your life.<br> 
            Remember that Tribal Leadership is not about changing ideas or gaining knowledge; it is about changing language and relationships.<br>
            It’s not about intellectualization; it’s about actions.</li>
        <li>Build a support network around you so that you are stable at Stage Four. Chapters 9 and 10 are the keys here.</li>
        <li>Take these actions as you upgrade the tribe around you. Remember that as a person builds to Stage Four she is recognized as the Tribal Leader,<br>
             which gives her the ability to bring the group to higher levels of success.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Once you have completed the “prep work” on yourself and have gotten a core group of people in your tribe to Stage Four, there are shortcuts that<br>
        stabilize them very quickly so that they don’t fall back to Stage Three. Chapters 9  through 11 explain these techniques. Pay special attention<br> 
        to triads, values, developing a noble cause , and building a tribal strategy. Leaders can upgrade most tribes one full level within ninety days,<br> 
        boosting everything from revenue to employee satisfaction. You will find many free tools and resources on our Web site, <a href="http://www.triballeadership.net">Tribal Leadership</a>.

    <p>
        In the next five chapters, we will go through each stage and show exactly how Tribal Leaders advance individuals within the tribe to the next level of effectiveness.<br> 
        We now turn to the language and customs of each culture, and the next chapter takes us to Stage One.

<h2>How to Become a Tribal Leader </h2>
<p>The people who use the stage-specific leverage points to upgrade the tribal culture emerge as Tribal leaders. Such individuals, we’ve found in our research, do a lot of work on themselves as they make changes in the tribe. This “Tribal Leader prep work” includes</p>

<div class="special-paragraph">
    <ul>
        <li>Learning the language and customs of all five cultural stages. Look at the next six chapters as a travel guide for all five lands.</li>
        <li>Listening for which tribal members speak which language- in essence, who is at what stage?</li>
        <li>Moving yourself forward, so that your own “center of gravity” is at least Stage Four. You can do this only by talking a different language and shifting the structure of relationships around you. Chapter 7 is the most important in the book -if you let it, it will nudge you into seeing the value of Stage Four and the hollowness of Stage Three. We suggest you spend some time thinking about the content of that chapter and discussing it with important people in your life. Remember that Tribal Leadership is not about changing ideas or gaining knowledge; it is about changing language and relationships.
            It’s not about intellectualization; it’s about actions.</li>
        <li>Build a support network around you so that you are stable at Stage Four. Chapters 9 and 10 are the keys here.</li>
        <li>Take these actions as you upgrade the tribe around you. Remember that as a person builds to Stage Four she is recognized as the Tribal Leader, which gives her the ability to bring the group to higher levels of success.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Once you have completed the “prep work” on yourself and have gotten a core group of people in your tribe to Stage Four, there are shortcuts that stabilize them very quickly so that they don’t fall back to Stage Three. Chapters 9  through 11 explain these techniques. Pay special attention to triads, values, developing a noble cause, and building a tribal strategy. Leaders can upgrade most tribes one full level within ninety days, boosting everything from revenue to employee satisfaction. You will find many free tools and resources on our Web site, <a href="http://www.triballeadership.net">Tribal Leadership</a>.

        In the next five chapters, we will go through each stage and show exactly how Tribal Leaders advance individuals within the tribe to the next level of effectiveness. We now turn to the language and customs of each culture, and the next chapter takes us to Stage One.

<ul>
<li>Each cultural stage has its own way of speaking, types of behavior, and structures of relationshps.</li>
<li>Tribal Leaders do two things: </li>

    <ol>
        <li>listen for which cultures exist in their tribes and</li>
        <li>upgrade those tribes using specific leverage points. ( The chapters that follow detail each cultural stage and present the leverage points to move to the next stage.)</li>
